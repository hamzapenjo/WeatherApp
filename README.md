Introduction
------------

The Weatherly app is an Android application designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for various cities. The application allows users to view current weather conditions, add cities to their favorites, and share weather details with others. Built using modern Android development tools such as Jetpack Compose and Retrofit, the app offers a clean and intuitive user interface along with efficient data fetching capabilities.

Architecture
------------

The app follows a straightforward architecture pattern that emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. The architecture is composed of the following layers:

*   **Model**: This layer represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes data classes that define the structure of weather data and Retrofit service interfaces for making network requests to fetch weather information from the API.
    
*   **View**: This layer comprises the UI components of the app, built using Jetpack Compose. It includes various Composables such as HomeScreen, FavoritesScreen, and IntroScreen, which are responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
    

By using Jetpack Compose for UI development and Retrofit for network operations, the architecture leverages modern Android libraries that simplify development, improve performance, and enhance code readability.

#### Responsibilities:

*   Displaying a welcome message and a brief description of the app.
    
*   Providing a button for the user to proceed to the main screen of the app.
    

Detailed Screen Descriptions
----------------------------

### Intro Screen

The Intro Screen is the first screen users see when they open the Weatherly app. It is designed to provide a welcoming experience and introduce users to the app's main functionalities.

#### Layout:

*   **Logo**: A placeholder for the app's logo is displayed at the top center of the screen.
    
*   **Welcome Message**: Below the logo, a welcome message "Welcome to Weatherly" is displayed in a large, bold font.
    
*   **Description**: A brief description of the app, "Get accurate and up-to-date weather information for your favorite cities," is provided below the welcome message.
    
*   **Continue Button**: A button labeled "Continue" is centered at the bottom, allowing users to proceed to the main functionality of the app.
    

The Intro Screen is designed with a vertical layout, ensuring all elements are neatly stacked and centered.

### Home Screen

The Home Screen is the main screen of the Weatherly app, where users can search for and view weather information for various cities.

#### Layout:

*   **Search Bar**: Positioned at the top of the screen, the search bar allows users to input city names. It includes a text field and a search icon button.
    
*   **Weather Information**: Below the search bar, the weather information for the specified city is displayed. This includes:
    
    *   **City Name**: Displayed in a large font.
        
    *   **Temperature**: Shown below the city name in a prominent font size.
        
    *   **Weather Icon**: An icon representing the current weather conditions.
        
    *   **Humidity**: Displayed as a percentage.
        
    *   **Pressure**: Shown in hPa units.
        
    *   **Wind Speed**: Displayed in m/s units.
        

In horizontal layout, the search bar remains at the top, while the weather information is arranged in two columns, with temperature and weather icon on the left and humidity, pressure, and wind speed on the right.

### Favorites Screen

The Favorites Screen allows users to view and manage their list of favorite cities, each with its respective weather information.

#### Layout:

*   **Favorite Cities List**: A scrollable list of favorite cities is displayed. Each item in the list includes:
    
    *   **City Name**: Displayed in a bold font.
        
    *   **Temperature**: Shown next to the city name.
        
    *   **Weather Icon**: Displayed next to the temperature.
        
    *   **Delete Button**: An icon button to remove the city from the favorites list.
        

In horizontal layout, the list remains scrollable but is displayed in a wider format, allowing more information to be visible without scrolling.

General Android Concepts
------------------------

### Activity

An Activity in Android represents a single screen with a user interface. In the Weatherly app, MainActivity serves as the main entry point and manages the navigation between different screens using Jetpack Compose.

### Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. The Weatherly app utilizes Jetpack Compose to create the user interface for screens like HomeScreen, FavoritesScreen, and IntroScreen.

### Retrofit

Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, developed by Square. It simplifies the process of making network requests and parsing responses. In the Weatherly app, Retrofit is used to fetch weather data from a weather API, enabling the app to display up-to-date weather information for various cities.
